Dear Sir/Madam,
                On behalf of SCPPGICA, I am pleased to invite your esteemed organization for the first round of placement drive 2020. We have been running the MCA program at “Shri Chimanbhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Computer Applications” since 2002 with more than 16 batches graduating since inception. The students are right now in MCA Semester-5 and they are up for grabs for an internship of 4 months scheduled tentatively between Jan-2021 to Apr-2021.
            During this internship of 4 months, the students are supposed to complete a project (preferably live) at your organization. During this tenure, you can judge the students’ work ethics and technical knowledge for taking a call on whether to hire them for a full-time role.
            We prefer only those companies which do not charge for project training and allow the student once every week for reporting to the college.
            The placement drive is scheduled to start from 17th August onwards and we have only 90 odd students to grab. If you are interested in participating, kindly provide us the details in the attached format. The filled form with company stamp (seal) and concerned person’s signature should be e-mailed to harishmorwani@gmail.com with a cc to mca@cpi.edu.in.

            Looking for a positive response at the earliest.
 
Contact Person(s):
Prof. Harish Morwani - 9924446340  (between 10AM - 4PM)
 
 
 
Regards,
Placement Team-SCPPGICA
